The main motive for creating this site/blog was to have somewhere to showcase what I've done and to share some of my
thoughts. I could have gone for a blogging platform like Tumblr, but what's the fun in that? So I decided to build a
simple site and host it somewhere for cheap (preferably free). These were the reasons how I ended up with the website
that you're on right now.

As per the title, this site was made with Gatsby, a React-based open-source framework for building websites and apps. In
my use case, Gatsby is being used as a static site generator(SSG). Using SSG comes with many benefits, but most
importantly, it removes the need for a backend server. This meant that the site could be easily set up on GitHub Pages
without additional backend services.

There is a multitude of SSG available on the web nowadays. From Go-based Hugo to the Jekyll, the default SSG of GitHub
Pages, there will be one that fits your needs. For me, I've chosen Gatsby for its ease of use and also because it was
React-based. Part of the reason for building this website from scratch was to practice some React frontend coding.

Setting up was easy with the help of a [Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM). I also
supplemented it with some materials for React from
this [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/). Overall it's been a fun
experience, but there's still quite a lot to do in terms of the layout and UI/UX. I think the site has the basic
functionalities that I set out to achieve are done, and I am ready to start the next project. I'll continue to update
the site layout from time to time, but for now, I am contented that I can share some of my thoughts here.

Cheers!
