Hello there!

This blog is a place for me to keep a journal of sorts of the projects that I am currently working on, as well as those
that I've worked on. I'll try to include some of my thoughts, what I've learned, the challenges faced as well as
resources that I had found useful in the process.

If you're interested (for whatever reasons), you can find more details about me [here](/about) or contact
me [here](/contact).

Cheers!
