I could have gone for a blogging platform like Tumblr, but what's the fun in that? So I decided to build a\nsimple site and host it somewhere for cheap (preferably free). These were the reasons how I ended up with the website\nthat you're on right now.</p>\n<p>As per the title, this site was made with Gatsby, a React-based open-source framework for building websites and apps. In\nmy use case, Gatsby is being used as a static site generator(SSG). Using SSG comes with many benefits, but most\nimportantly, it removes the need for a backend server. This meant that the site could be easily set up on GitHub Pages\nwithout additional backend services.</p>\n<p>There is a multitude of SSG available on the web nowadays. From Go-based Hugo to the Jekyll, the default SSG of GitHub\nPages, there will be one that fits your needs. For me, I've chosen Gatsby for its ease of use and also because it was\nReact-based. Part of the reason for building this website from scratch was to practice some React frontend coding.</p>\n<p>Setting up was easy with the help of a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM\">Youtube tutorial</a>. I also\nsupplemented it with some materials for React from\nthis <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/\">Udemy course</a>. Overall it's been a fun\nexperience, but there's still quite a lot to do in terms of the layout and UI/UX. I think the site has the basic\nfunctionalities that I set out to achieve are done, and I am ready to start the next project. I'll continue to update\nthe site layout from time to time, but for now, I am contented that I can share some of my thoughts here.</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gatsby-site"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","440568431"]}
